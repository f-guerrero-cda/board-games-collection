Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.</Description></BoardGame><BoardGame><Id>16</Id><Name>Seeland</Name><Year>0</Year><Category>Economic, Farming</Category><Players>2-4</Players><Description>Seeland plays in the golden era of the Netherlands (17th century).
