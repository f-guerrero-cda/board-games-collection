    <Description>Ghostbusters: The Board Game is an episodic adventure game for one to four players, who are charged with busting ghosts and sealing gates to the Spirit World. In the game, players choose one of the four Ghostbusters character figures — Peter Venkman, Egon Spengler, Winston Zeddemore and Ray Stantz — then select one of the game's pre-written scenarios, beginning a game session that lasts from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on the chosen scenario(s) and degree of difficulty. Each of the Ghostbusters has unique traits and talents that can assist the entire team, with highly co-operative gameplay. As players gain experience from banishing spirits, the Ghostbusters level up, gaining new abilities that help them take on greater challenges. The team can also hop in the Ecto-1, the Ghostbusters' converted ambulance, to help them quickly move through the city.</Description>
